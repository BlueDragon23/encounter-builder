# Encounters

This is a tool for building and running encounters. It has been designed with D&D 5e in mind, but may be flexible
enough to accommodate other systems with similar mechanics.

## Creatures

Creatures can be imported using a format taken from More Purple More Better (MPMB).
An example from their code can be found
here (https://github.com/morepurplemorebetter/MPMBs-Character-Record-Sheet/blob/master/_variables/ListsCreatures.js).
